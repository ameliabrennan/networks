# networks

An initial arrangement for collaborating on Peter's network mapping script.

Also beginning to be the defacto repository for RMIT Studios shared code - this will change in the future.

Note the repository is PUBLIC for now, so make sure no data or sensitive files are uploaded.

Some basics to start:

- make sure git is installed on your computer (command line: $ git --version)
- create a GitHub account

- cd to where you want the repository to be, then do
  $ git clone https://github.com/ameliabrennan/networks.git
  This should create a directory called networks with a few files in it

- Check if you're up-to-date, and what files you've changed : 	$ git status
- Get whatever changes have been made: 				$ git pull
- Add edited files to the commit: 				$ git add file_name
- Commit the changes: $ git commit -m "Useful message explaining your changes"
- Get any changes made while you were faffing about: 		$ git pull
- Upload your changes: 						$ git push
